7\) Click `Confirm` to approve your deposit or click `Edit` to increase the gas fee if Ethereum is busy \(check [https://ethgasstation.info](https://ethgasstation.info/) for current rates\). If you are depositing more than one type of token \(e.g. DAI and USDC\) you will need to do this step to approve each one.

9\) Once the approval is processed, click `Confirm` to actually make the depost \(or edit the gas fee first as before if you want to increase it\).

10\) You will see this screen as your transaction is processing. If this takes too long, you may not have set a high enough gas fee or you may have a stuck transaction, check our [FAQ page](https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#i-sent-my-eth-transaction-but-it-says-pending-how-do-i-fix-this) for how to resolve slow or stuck transactions.
