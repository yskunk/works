# How To Participate in a yVault

This visual guide will walk you through every step in depositing funds in a [yVault](https://docs.yearn.finance/products/yvaults).

## Prerequisites

- You must have the yVault's underlying token. For DAI yVault, you must have DAI.
- You must use a supported wallet, either Metamask, Trustwallet, Trezor, or Torus.

## Walkthrough

### 1. Go to [Vaults page](https://yearn.finance/vaults) and click on “Connect your wallet”

Click on **25%, 50%, 75% or 100%** to deposit the corresponding proportion of your wallet into the Vault.

Or click “Deposit All” if you would like to **deposit 100%** of the chosen digital asset from your wallet into the Vault.

Please note before you make a deposit that there is a **0.5% withdrawal fee**. The longer you leave the deposit to earn returns in the Vault, the more likely your returns will exceed the withdrawal fee.

### 7. Approve yearn.finance to spend your DAI token (first time only) and then click “Confirm” again to approve the deposit

You need to pay a **transaction fee in Ether (ETH)** to approve yearn.finance to spend your DAI.

Make sure there is **enough ETH in your wallet**.

### 8. Receive your yToken (in this case it would be yDAI)

The yDAI you receive is your **share of the DAI Vault**. The amount of yDAI in your wallet will **remain constant** over time but the value of it will increase as the DAI Vault earns returns.

The amount of yDAI you receive will be less than 1 per DAI you deposited because yDAI is worth more than 1 DAI.

For example, at block number 10611372 yDAI was equal to 1.044 DAI. Therefore had you deposited 100 DAI, you would have received 95.78 yDAI (100 / 1.044).

### 9. Track your earnings
