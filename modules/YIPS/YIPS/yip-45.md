## Simple Summary
Add a bounty for proposing YIPs that are implemented.

## Abstract
Implement a $500 yCRV bounty for proposing a YIP that reaches the ‘Implemented’ phase, payable from the treasury.

## Motivation
This should incentivize community members to propose useful YIPs which should be beneficial for the protocol. This is inspired by the 500 sUSD bounty that Synthetix pays out for [implemented SIPs](https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs#contributing).

**FOR**: Start offering a bounty for proposing YIPs that are implemented.

**AGAINST**: No change.
