## Simple Summary
Implement an inflation schedule of 20,000 YFI over the next 8 years, with 12,802 distributed in the first 3 years, ending with a trailing tail of 1% inflation.

## Abstract
* Update the YFI mint contract to reflect new inflation schedule.

## Motivation
To create an inflation schedule after the passing of YIP-0.

**FOR**: Implement an inflation schedule of 20,000 YFI over the next 8 years, with 12,802 distributed in the first 3 years, ending with a trailing tail of 1% inflation.

**AGAINST**: No changes.

## Specification

### Overview
1. Adjust supply schedule to follow [[YFI Inflation Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yomUGpAWR8svL9RXD-_vL2ArgQPGj1x2XPNKDEuZR9Q/edit?usp=sharing)].
  - Beginning annual inflation: 22.384%
  - Weekly emissions reduction multiplier: 0.9937
  - Week that terminal inflation starts: 416 weeks
  - Fixed % ongoing inflation (tail emission): 1%
2. This model will stay in place until it is stopped or adjusted.

### Rationale

* Liquidity provider yields are maintained at reasonably competitive levels in various YFI price and TVL scenarios (see modeling sheet).
* Lower initial inflation (22%) to keep long-term rewards reasonable.
* 8 year emission schedule to support long-term development.
