  yEarn Improvement Proposals (YIPs) describe standards for the yEarn
  platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract
  standards.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Review <a href="YIPS/yip-0">YIP-0</a>.</li>
  <li>Fork the repository by clicking "Fork" in the top right.</li>
  <li>
    Add your YIP to your fork of the repository. There is a
    <a href="https://github.com/iearn-finance/YIPS/blob/master/yip-X.md"
      >template YIP here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit a Pull Request to yEarn's
    <a href="https://github.com/iearn-finance/YIPS">YIPs repository</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final YIP. It must meet the
  formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the
  header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new YIP and assign
  it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open
  GitHub issue where people can discuss the YIP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  If your YIP requires images, the image files should be included in a
  subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that YIP as follow:
  <code>assets/yip-X</code> (for yip <b>X</b>). When linking to an image in the
  YIP, use relative links such as <code>../assets/yip-X/image.png</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your YIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase,
  you should ask to have your issue added to the next governance call where it
  can be discussed for inclusion in a future platform upgrade. If the community
  agrees to include it, the YIP editors will update the state of your YIP to
  <code>Approved</code>.
</p>
